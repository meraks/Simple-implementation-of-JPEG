# Simple-implementation-of-JPEG



This is a simple implementation of JPEG.Use Run Length Coding or Huffman Coding.
It's mainly referenced by im2jpeg and jpeg2im from DIPUM.There ara totally 4 type
of coding method, whitch is 'rlc', 'huffman', 'mix', 'simpleHuffman'. The type of
'huffman' is fully copied from im2jpeg. Learn more about type 'mix', refer to 
https://github.com/benbenmumu/JPEG-MATLAB, type 'mix' based on the program.
It's necessary to add several m files from DIPUM toolbox if you would like to use 
type 'huffman', such as mat2huff, huffman and huff2mat.
